# Why Use It
I used to downloading progammes and files in GitHub but never thought of signing up for it until summer 2024 when I want to cooperate with my friend, [Disemo](https://github.com/Disembo/), to develop a toolkit for recording experiments called [ChemPrompter](https://github.com/Disembo/ChemPrompter).

Since then, I find it useful for cooperation online, management of sources and a excellent platform for sharing ideas.

However, several tricks need to be adopted to use Git and GitHub properly in China. Here is the procedure to get started.

# What It Is
* **Git** : a version control system (Local)
* **GitHub**: a cloud-based hosting service for Git (Remote)
* **VSCode**: an **integrated** code editor which I use it to edit python, javascript, html, markdown, latex etc.


# How To Use It
## Download
* **Git**
* **GitHub Desktop** (**Very Important** apart from convenience)
* **Visual Studio Code**
* **Clash for windows**

 ## Configuration
 Refer to tutorial online.
 ## Need to Mention
Having tried countless times with numerous methods, I find it necessary to use Git, GitHub and VSCode in China with the following principles.

* By default, **Clash** does not work for terminal(cmd and bash). 
    * Hence, we could not push or publish repository using GitBash or VSCode only.
    * We can push or publish branch using **GitHub Desktop** or in Browser which can work under system proxy of Clash.
* **Git** can work locally. Therefore there is no need to open system proxy in Clash when we don't want to publish it.
