# Introduction
ChatGPT's capbility should not be underestimated as least in terms of knowledge base.

Although I believe ChatGPT and AI do not own insight of innovation, they do have grasp numerous knowledge and can help us do some tedious works.

Here are what I use it for:

* **Ask for the meaning of some terms**, for example: https, URL, DNS, cmd, ssh etc. 
*(I find it a convenient way to learn some common as well as unimportant terms, while if I want to delve into them deeply WiKi might be a better choice in the consideration of accuracy.)*

* In the field of progamming, I should use several languages simultaneously, such as python, javascript, html while each of them has many libraries or modules like matploylib, numpy, pandas etc. Besides, to take notes effectively, I should get familiar with markdown and LaTeX language which also like a kinds of programming language. Finally, the commands in terminal like cmd (for windows operation system), shell, bash(for git) also have different grammar or syntax. It is impossible to remember them all which is also unjustified. So **ChatGPT can help me programming and using numerous softwares** (both in command line and in Graphic User Interface).

* **Complete the meaningless theses and reports** which is the product of formalism. And that is what ChatGPT is good at.

* **Work me through a new field** in an efficient way. While there is no guarantee of accuracy, most of its replies is true to some extent, especially for those basic knowledge in a specific field. So ChatGPT can help me *get started* quickly.

# Obstacles and Solutions
Since ChatGPT is not open to people in some region, proxy tools like Clash is needed. (If you want to try other Large Language Model, it's not a problem anymore)

When it comes to signing up for it, however, region becomes a big problem. Clash on its own is not enough. We'd better go with a google account which is also useful elsewhere. One thing need to mention is that Google account can be set up without a mobile phone number and it is free. So, instead of buying an account, you can sign up one by your self.
