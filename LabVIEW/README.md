# Introduction
LabVIEW is version susceptible, which means terrible compatibility of codes and LabVIEW software of different versions.

I am using LabVIEW 2021 and the examples were written in that version.

As taught by my teacher, the best way to get started with LabVIEW is to find prime numbers between 1 and 100 million in several seconds, where LabVIEW is weak in. It seems to be contradictory, but reasonable actually.
