# Introduction
LabVIEW is version susceptible, which means terrible compatibility of codes and LabVIEW software of different versions.

I am using LabVIEW 2021 and the examples were written in that version.

As taught by my teacher, the best way to get started with LabVIEW is to find prime numbers between 1 and 100 million in several seconds, where LabVIEW is weak in. It seems to be contradictory, but reasonable actually.

The two examples are related to my experiment [here](https://github.com/FFRC037-PKU/Experiment-Reports/tree/main/%E4%B8%80%E4%BA%BF%E4%BB%A5%E5%86%85%E7%B4%A0%E6%95%B0).
